This compressed folder contains the following:

1. Presentation and information about the project (.PDF)
2. An executable JAR file
3. Source code


### HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

#### STEP 1:

In order to run the program you must either (1) import the entire project to your favorite Java Integrated Development Environment, such as Eclipse, NetBeans, BlueJ, etc; (2) or simply execute the executable JAR file. 

1) Using Eclipse:

For Eclipse simply go to File --> Import , go to the "General" tab and choose: "Existing Projects into Workspace". Hit NEXT and then, for the root directory option, after clicking Browse, choose the folder inside the zip file provided, called "BattleShip". After succesfully importing, simply run the BSThread.java or SetUp.java.

2) Running the executable JAR file

As simple as double clicking. Not much to it. If you get a message asking for permissions make sure you accept.

#### STEP 2:

For the next step you must have NetCat installed, because it's the tool we'll be using to connect to the game. 

If you don't have NetCat download it from here:

Windows: http://joncraton.org/media/files/nc111nt.zip

Linux: http://netcat.sourceforge.net/download.php

You might need to set the directory of the netcat executable to your PATH Environmental Variables. That, or have the exec netcat file in your current directory.

For Windows: Start button --> Type cmd --> Run cmd

For Linux: Should be easy to find somewhere.

#### STEP 3:

To connect to the computer running application that we executed in step 1 we must know the IP Address of the computer where it's running. Typing "ipconfig" (without 
quotes) in a terminal will easily show you your local IP address in the case of playing with another player in the same Internet connection.

After we know the IP address, to connect we type on somebody else's terminal the command:

nc IPNUMBERGOESHERE 7777

For example: nc 192.168.1.153 7777

In case you, the person that's running the program would like to participate in the game, you COULD use your own IP address, but you can also substitute it for localhost

nc localhost 7777

#### STEP 4:

And that's it! If you did everything correctly you should be playing already!

Good luck! And happy sinking!
